# XMedicus Regent assignment

### Here are the [Laust Eberhardt Bonnesen's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laust-eberhardt-bonnesen/) answer of the assignment at [LINK](https://github.com/adbir/regentsBlazor/).

### As the assignment recommends, there is an use of Linq both as converting from JSON and the use of operator in the view.

### Actually the field of assignment of how many years Denmark has been without rule was a bit doubt of, when it comes to the gap between each rule, if it was the interregnum and if it was including from the start of Denmark aroung 700-800.

## I hope you will enjoy reading the code and will have a nice day.
